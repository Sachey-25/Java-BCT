Methods in Java
------------------
Java - Static class, Block, Methods and variables.

Static keyword can be used with class, variables, methods and block. 
Static members belong to the class instead. 
-- This means if you make a member statis, you can access it 
without an object. 

class SimpleStaticexample{
	//methods 
	1. we can make use of access specifiers 
	>> public, priavte and static
	2. The naming conventions for methods is should start with lowercase. 
	--- if a word is lengthy we need make first letter uppercase. 
	
	example
	
	public void additionOfTwoNumbers(){} <--- Signature of method.
	private void additionOfTwoNumbers(){} 
	static void additionOfTwoNumbers(){}
	after the access spevifiers we need to make sure the return type -- int, void, String
}

there are two types
1. User-defined methods
2. Standard library methods
