            "Sachin is an Indian cricketer widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in
            the history of cricket.
            He is the leading run-scorer and century maker in Test and One Day International
            cricket            
            Sachin Tendulkar has been the most complete batsman of his time, 
            and arguably the biggest cricket icon as well. His batting is based on 
            the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, 
            precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses:
            anticipation. If he doesn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot 
            punch comes close - 
            <p style="border: 2px solid black; color:yellowgreen;">it is because he is equally proficient at each of the 
                full range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and 
                can pull them out at will."</p>

            Transperant boxes.
            -- When using the opactity to add Transperancy to the background of 
            an element, all of its child elements become transparent as well. 
            This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read:
        </p>
        <div class="first">

        </div>
        <div class="two">
