        <h2>Dinosaur</h2>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria.
            They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 
            million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution
            of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant
            terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassicâ€“Jurassic extinction event 201.3 
            mya; their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods
